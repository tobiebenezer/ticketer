# Ticket Sales App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and progress for creating a comprehensive Ticket Sales and Validation Flutter application. The app will enable users to browse events, purchase tickets, and validate tickets using QR codes.

## Features Implemented

### Core App Structure
- **Project Setup:** Initialized a new Flutter project.
- **Theming:** Implemented a theme provider for easy switching between light and dark modes, using `provider` for state management.
- **UI and Styling:** Created a modern and visually appealing UI with custom fonts from `google_fonts`.

### Event Browsing
- **API Service:** Created a service to fetch event and ticket data from a mock API.
- **Data Models:** Defined data models for events and tickets.
- **Home Screen:** Developed the main screen to display a list of available events.
- **Event Details:** Created a screen to show detailed information about a selected event.
- **Caching:** Implemented local caching of event data using `shared_preferences` to provide a seamless offline experience.
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Added pull-to-refresh functionality to manually refresh the event data.

### Ticket Sales
- **Sell Ticket Screen:** Created a screen with a customer information form and an order summary.
- **Form Validation:** Implemented form validation to ensure all required fields are filled correctly.
- **Sale Confirmation Screen:** Developed a screen to confirm the sale and display a unique QR code for the ticket using the `qr_flutter` package.
- **Navigation:** Integrated the sales flow into the app, allowing users to navigate from the event details screen to the sell ticket screen and then to the confirmation screen.

### Ticket Validation
- **QR Code Scanner:** Integrated a QR code scanner using the `mobile_scanner` package.
- **Validator Screen:** Created a screen to scan QR codes.
- **Validation Result Screen:** Developed a screen to display whether a ticket is valid or invalid based on the scanned QR code.
- **Navigation:** Added a button to the home screen to allow users to navigate to the ticket validator screen.

## Current Plan

All core features outlined in the initial plan have been implemented. The application is now a functional prototype for a ticket sales and validation system.

### Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- **Backend Integration:** Replace the mock API service with a real backend to handle event data, ticket sales, and validation.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway to process real payments.
- **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to allow users to create accounts and view their order history.
- **Animations and UI Polish:** Add animations and further polish the UI to enhance the user experience.
